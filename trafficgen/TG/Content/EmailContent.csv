Gas Control was called on both these meters and informed of the new numbers and asked to call Channels Gas Control to confirm. 10:00am Sam from Gas Control called and informed me that the Bayer plants didn't want to take any gas from HPL due to the water content. The tail gate still had the intraday change in place and so does Midcon apparently so were rolling the move another day. Lee said yesterday that he didn't care were they get the gas.

So we did. We will need to update pops. 1:00 pm Marilyn from Oasis called with some cuts. A 10000 and a 5000 package was cut going to ANP TA0020. I called Mark and he said t l move the 10000 back haul to HPL which I did. The 5000 Duke gas we moved over to 5896 and will move to back to HPL on our 202 contract. Marilyn said there will be a 1% fuel and a 4 cent change but we could pay the fuel at another time or use it against the imbalance so she confirmed the full 5000. New meter total is 49765. 4:00pm Cindy PGE called with more cuts 96d5 was cut from 16259 to 16100 9g96 was cut from 45000 to 36215. Cindy said that they would not park the gas this time for us.

I called Mark and he said t l move the 10000 back haul to HPL which I did. The 5000 Duke gas we moved over to 5896 and will move to back to HPL on our 202 contract. Marilyn said there will be a 1% fuel and a 4 cent change but we could pay the fuel at another time or use it against the imbalance so she confirmed the full 5000. New meter total is 49765. 4:00pm Cindy PGE called with more cuts 96d5 was cut from 16259 to 16100 9g96 was cut from 45000 to 36215. Cindy said that they would not park the gas this time for us. I called Eddie to inform and he said he would call Cindy and dazzle her with his charm and wit and fix the problem. Well that didn't work so we ended up moving it from TECO on the Mid TEX line to 8740 on HPL.

Co 1580 more data since phone call - question has changed.,In June we forced income before taxes to be zero. There was a $262.00 tax asset posted in June and jumped to $54K in July. We did not force income before taxes to be zero for July. July income before taxes was a loss of $157K. $54K tax asset is about 1/3 of this which seems logical so I think that July is okay. I don't understand how the June tax asset of $262.00 was generated. This company the TB and 1581 the related payroll company is shutting down and we have to reverse everything on this company by October.

Re: Consumers Energy,The title transfer fee is much like Michcon's in that if you move gas from one marketer to another such as Columbia Energy Services to TXU instead of nominating directly to the end user themselves they charge you a title transfer fee. TXU is the agent for Dahlmer Chrysler who is CES' end user customer. Therefore if Columbia were able to nominate from their pool DIRECTLY to Dahlmer Chysler they would not be charged the title transfer fee. However since TXU is there agent and CES has to nominate to TXU (marketer to marketer) they are charge the fee.
Consumers Energy,Would you please write a description on how Consumers Energy works on the billing for title transfers? I need to explain this to Doug Kenny still. Thanks.

Re: Tenn supply in Zone 4,On the Tennessee side this deal was handled as a Back to Back and was therefore not 'scheduled' so I really never dealt with the particulars of this deal. I will try and dig up whatever info I can find on this issue. Phil
Re: Retail Exhibit,Thanks...Billy
Boston Gas,Just a quick note to check the status of the Boston Gas program. Can you confirm that the capacity will be recalled from ENA and reput to Metromedia for July? Last week Boston said the paperwork from both parties was not completed. Please Advise. Scott
Re: Consumers Energy,The title transfer fee is much like Michcon's in that if you move gas from one marketer to another such as Columbia Energy Services to TXU instead of nominating directly to the end user themselves they charge you a title transfer fee. TXU is the agent for Dahlmer Chrysler who is CES' end user customer. Therefore if Columbia were able to nominate from their pool DIRECTLY to Dahlmer Chysler they would not be charged the title transfer fee. However since TXU is there agent and CES has to nominate to TXU (marketer to marketer) they are charge the fee.

CGAS Strg,Hi there. We changed our CGAS storage numbers today and we have fixed the Sitara deals and worksheet.

Sjersey for 1/00,For January 2000 for a couple of weekends SJersey tried to do intradays. Due to the interconnect and other supply we were not able to change their nominations. South Jersey have always been told that changing nomination on the weekend would be on best available. Julie Punches from Sjersey due to her changes on the weekend is over at some of her CDC markets is asking to allocate the excess gas to CES agg pools. Would this be something Enron would do???

I spoke to Elsa Villarreal (works for Houston Pipeline). She called Todd Lambert in her Columbus office and Todd told Elsa that AEP will not buy gas from Enron. I'll keep you guys posted on my Bridgeline notes through out the day.
metered production on CGAS,Do you want to work with Wade Price on the Appalachian suppliers on CGAS? I think we are still getting gas because contracts have not been terminated or something like that. It will probably be tedious but it doesn't matter to me. Just let me know.
yo,Who do I call to get my palm hooked up to my computer? I have the palm cradle sitting on my desk.
Boo,I just got to work about 10 min ago. Key Lay has resigned from the Board of Directors. I brought in those chocolate hearts and passed them out to my little group. I told the guys that I DO discriminate because I gave all the guys 1 chocolate and all the girls 2 chocolates. How's your day?

Re: what doing?,ya don't say?
Re:,Yeah you like that? Aren't you just little miss grammer today!
Hi,So are you not talking to me anymore or something? I emailed once and called twice in the past week and a half and haven't heard back from you?
RE: FW: hi!,You love it when I pick on you.
Re: Real-Time Position Opening,Bill I have a freind that just graduated from Oregon State with a business degree i think his emphasis was MIS and finance. He is a pretty bright kid and wants to pursue a carrer in finance. I actually talked to him about it at some length about Enron on New Years Day and he seemed very interested. . He is a friend of mine from my fraternity and a really good guy who I think would fit in well here if given the opportunity. I dont know about your feelings on hiring guys right out of college. I know we had done so in the past but I wasn't really sure about your feelings on that. Let me know.
Re: Recall:,What the hell?
Re: Saturday Night,Hey sharkey. I will be out of town the 23rd thru the 30th. How long are you going to be in town for?
RE: FW: hi!,Thats a dilema.
Re: Holiday Pay,Thank you for your prompt response!
Re: Christmas party December 16th,Oh yeah and I might bring Price Strader too.
Re: Christmas party December 16th,Is it allright if I bring Marc Johnson?
Re:,Hardy Har Har...... I meant on the game itself not you drinking or not drinking? By the way why are you not drinking at the game
RE: FW: hi!,I am not to picky. I dated you didn't I?
RE: Marc Coming to Town,Dude. I will be having some beers with our friend Marc Johnson on Friday night. I will be down in SF today thru Sunday and he is going to be there to. Also when i talked to him today he said he is planning on coming up the weekend of the 15th so I will keep you posted. See ya
ok,okay this should fix it.
RE: FW: hi!,Yeah I guess that makes sense. I thought you were madly in love with this cat.
RE: Marc Coming to Town,sounds good. give me a call on Sunday and let me know or i will try and get a hold of you
Re: Hey,All right you are done on both of those games and I want delivery of the funny story today before you forget. Unless it is about me and then I just don't even want to know.
Re: Christmas party December 16th,My address is 1515 NW 28th Apt7 Portland OR 97210
RE:,So lets see. You want me to take time out of my busy schedule so that you can plan a date with some dude?
RE:,No.
RE: FW: hi!,So how are you and what his face doing?
RE:,Well you know I got a rep to uphold and i don't want to be out on the town with someone looking all scrappy!
RE:,Are you gonna wear something cute tonight?
Re: Marc Coming to Town,Hey how late will he be here on sunday. I think I get in town at 5
Hey,So what time did you end up getting home on Saturday night. I was absolutely demolished on Sunday and left the house only to come down and pick up my car which was at the Embassy Suites? Did ya have fun?
Re: Marc Coming to Town,Sorry won't be there as I am going down to San Fran to have a few brews with Burns for the weekend.
Re: holiday ale fest,Where is the Holiday ale fest? Is it cool? Are you on some sort of secret beer newsletter that I am not getting? How come I only hear about this shit from you? I feel out of touch with the world of brewdom
RE: FW: hi!,Dude that is psycho! But i will still give her a break because she was cute.
RE: Yo,Wow! Someone has lost there sense of humor! Maybe you are having an estrogen overdose.
RE: Yo,I knew that would get you all worked up!
RE: Yo,I don't believe for a second that you didn't make plans with Dave! Monday will probably be okay. I would say lets plan on it but I know how bad you are about shit like that so just call me Sunday and let me know. If I don't hear from you by then I will just assume we aren't going. have a great day
RE: Yo,I could probably do monday night. I will have to get back to you. What happened to Friday?
RE: Yo,when am i getting my victory dinner. I figure I ought to hit you up now before you get bac together with dave
Re: SF,Whats up lil' Kirky. Don't worry about getting cut off I figured your phone just died or something. I am so excited to come down there and hang out in the city. I haven't hung out in the City since turning 21 and would love to go check things out. That would be awesome if you could come into town on Wednesday or Thursday night. Maybe we could grab dinner and some drinks. I called your brother last night and left a message telling him that I was going to be in town. Hopefully he isn't mad at me for all the assing out I did the weekend of Wilsons wedding. I think my body is still recovering from all those shenanigans. Anyway I will give you a call or email you early next week and let you know what our plan is for Wednesday and Thursday. Look forward to seeing ya sweetie. Take Care!
RE: FW: hi!,So I went out with a bunch of dudes from work last night. Me and my buddy Bill met these two chicks at the Saucebox and one of them asked for my number. So I pick up my cell phone this morning and theres a message. The chick called me last night! The night I freaking met her. HELLO PSYCHO!
Re: E-Clips News Flash,Whats up Lester. Are you going to go to the Bowl game. It looks right now like it might be the fiesta or the Holliday Bowl. If it is the Holliday Bowl i will probably go however if it is the Fiesta bowl I wont be able to make it. How is the family. Are you guys planning on coming out anytime soon
Re: I'm so sorry,Dont worry about it. I had a good time. I don't really know what our plan is for the Beaver Game as I am hanging out with Burns and some guys from my fraternity and hadn't really planned on hanging out with those guys until after the game. But you can give me a call on my cell phone that day and I can let you know where the Winnebago is and maybe you guys can come meet us or if not we can meet up after the game or something.
Re: **,So do I get a raincheck on Beaches?
Re: Turkey Day Football,I will be in LA folio. Sorry

RE:,If we would have sent that Beaver Morris's home loan email that beaver could have had a roof over his head and this never would have happened.
Re: FW: hi!,I actually thought you were being serious so thats why I didn't respond. That and I am super busy right now. Anyway talk to you later
RE: FW: What's up?,Sounds to me like this guy is full of shit!. As seems to be typical for most of those retards that used to work for Wilshire.
RE: FW: What's up?,I think Bruce Zechenelly used to work for Advanta. If you get an interview their I can call him and ask him how they are as a company.
RE: FW: What's up?,The fact that you are moving down there has nothing to do with whether or not I do. I was just joking. Stop be so over analytical. :) Did you talk to Danny about the offer?
Re: FW: What's up?,Your mom rocks!
Re: beaver game,My reccomendations would be either Silver Dollar or Sports Page.

Re: IMPORTANT!! Please Read Immediately!!,You Wanna Piece of My Heart.... You better start from the start
Re: tonight,Hey there. I am back and at work today. Thank you for the phone calls and sorry I didnt return them but I was just entirely to busy and recieved too many calls to return them all until I came home. I hope everything is going well for you. We will have to get together and grab a bite to eat or a beer or something this week. How was your weekend?
RE:,No come to find out Angelas little friend had herpes! YUCK! But actually you know her. It is Nicole. The girl that Jay was dating for a while. Jay didn't care but it caused a huge fight between Angela and I. It was pretty messy.
RE:,I feel bad but she understands. I think she might come up and be with me for thanksgiving. I have a six day break right around then and I think it would be good for her to just get away for a while. Guess what? I had a couple of dates while I was in LA. They went very well and she might come up in December for a weekend!
RE:,How come you wanted a date for halloween then?
RE:,I just looked at myu schedule and I have to work neew years eve during the day and I don't know yet about new years day.. It really isn't that big of a deal to me. The important thing for me right now is spending my free time to go down and spend time with my sister so I could kind of care less about going to the Beavers Bowl game when I can just watch it on TV. I mean it would be nice to go but it is not the slightest bit a priority for me right now. So are you and dave seeing each other exclusively or are you dating other people?
RE:,I just wasnt sure what we were doing thats all. Yes if the Beavs go I will go if i have the day off but it is not likely they will. We have to beat the ducks which is reasonable but UW has to lose which is not likely. Likely we will go to the holliday or sun bowls.
RE:,I said you cant just take away the dinner offer. I wanted to go to dinner but if you thought it was going to be a big issue between you and Dave I didn't want to cause a fight between you two or something.
RE:,so are we just doing lunch then or dinner or dinner at your parents or what?
RE:,So.........
RE:,Well you cant just take away the dinner offer. I just don't want to get you in trouble with Dave.
RE:,Uh.....sure I guess. Would Dave have a problem with that?
RE:,I don't work on thursday or Friday so I could meet you guys for lunch either of those days. Or we could grab a drink after work. It would be nice to hang out more than just a few minutes for lunch.
Re:,Thanks I so much appreciate the support. Actually I just got back from LA today so sorry I didnt write back. My father passed away a couple weeks ago and I have been down there taking care of everything for my sister. It has been a rough month. I will write back later in the week or maybe call you or something. How is everything with you?
Re: Mark Guzman,Thanks for the support Chris. I am very excited about the opportunity. Have a great weekend!
RE: hi!,Things are good. I have been very busy. Work is going really well. Other than that not much really. And you.
Re:,sorry charly. I don't have it
RE: good morning,i will give you a call around 6
RE: good morning,Would you wanna go see a movie or have a few beers or something? I have to stay out late tonight so I can get used to the new nighttime schedule and if I just sit at home i will fall asleep. I am going to try and stay up really late and then sleep really late tommorow morning to prepare.
Re: good morning,Hey what are you doing tonight?
thanks,Hey I just wanted to thank you for taking me to the airport on Friday. I owe you a couple beers. How was your weekend?
Re: Elk Hunt,No but I am getting the opportunity to trade by taking this position. It is an awesome position in that I will learn virtually every aspect of this business and get and trade daily energy. It is definetly a step up from my current position.
RE:,I am leaving now. I will see you at my house at 12. Thank you so much!
RE:,You are a superstar!
RE: Hello,the problem is that I need to go at noon.
Re: Jimmy Mak's,I am in. Do we have a volleyball game that night? If so what time?
Real Time Position,I would like to thank all of you for the opportunity to discuss the Real Time position with me today.

If you have any further questions please feel free to contact me. I am looking forward to your positive response. Thanks again Mark A Guzman
Re: Extra Game,I am going to be in LA until Tuesday night so unfortunately i will be unable to attend.
Re:,Sorry that i didn't respond I was in interviews for the past several hours. I am super busy right now but i will give you a call when I get back and we can hang out. Have a great weekend! Don't get in to much trouble
Week 6,my week six pick is cincinatti bengals. Thanks
Out of Office,FYI. I will be out of the office on Monday October 9th. I can be reached on my cell phone if neccesary. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
RE:,Is his drinking problem that bad or are his friends over reacting? Not to pile on or anything but yeah that was a bad idea bringing it up when he was drinking.
This weeks pick,This week I am picking San Diego to lose to the Rams.
RE:,uh.. how do I get a hold of you these days?
RE:,Do you want me to have him call you even if I don't go out with them?
RE:,I don't even know Dave so I wouldn't judge him. I just worry about you being with someone that has a bad temper like that. You know eventually that temper might be aimed at you. I know you can take care of yourself and I am sure he is a great guy and wouldn't do anything to hurt you but that doesn't mean I can't worry about ya. :) So I didn't go anywhere last night. I am feeling pretty sick and Burnsy's flight got cancelled so he didn't get in until about 12 last night. I haven't talked to him yet today and last time I talked to him i told him I had plans tonight which have been changed. I would like to go out with him but I don't really feel like drinking and I am really trying to cut back on it. This thing with my dad has really scared me about drinking and bieng more healthy. I am not pretending that I am going to stop drinking I just think it would be a great idea for me to cut back on it. There is no need for me to get as drunk as I did last weekend. Boy is that a great story! If I do go out with Burns tonight should I call you?
Re: where did you go?,what are you talking about?
RE:,Actually that doesnt sound very funny to me. I mean what the fuck did he do that for? What was he so mad about? I can imagine that you would be scared seeing him act like that. Hopefully he doesn't ever act like that or show that kind of temper around you. Anyway its really none of my business i guess. I appreciate the sentiment about my family and I will mention it to my mother. I hope you feel better.
Re: hoops,I am probably not going to make it. A) I am feeling sick. B) Burns is in town and if I am feeling better I wanted to hang out with him.
RE: FW: dunk heard round the world ......,I am not sure yet. I will email you tommorow morning and let you know.
RE: FW: dunk heard round the world ......,Whats your plan man. I know a few of us are going down early and drinking some beers at the peacock
RE: FW: dunk heard round the world ......,Yeah
Re: ENPOWER LOGIN,Damn! And to think I wont be getting all those visits from Virgina all the time now!
Miiddle Marketing Position,Just a quick note to thank all of you for allowing me the opportunity to interview for the Market Research position in the Middle Marketing Group. After interviewing for the position I still remain very interested in the possibility of becoming a valuable asset to your team. Once again thank you for the opportunity.
RE: good movies,Thanks that was awfully sweet of you.
RE: good movies,What happened?
RE: good movies,Just little things like I should be resolving my job situation by the end of next week and some other little stuff that has made me happy and a little more confident about stuff. Nothing too major. After how things went the last few months it doesn't take much!
RE: good movies,Mine doesnt suck either. I have actually had some good stuff happen to me lately!
RE: good movies,Yeah yeah yeah. My life sucks too!
Re: good movies,Thanks for the movie advice. I am glad that you went out with Kathy and Charlene. I think it is good for you guys to keep in touch. I know people move on with their lives and grow out of touch but it seems like you guys have been friends for so long that it would be a shame for you to not keep in touch with each other. Sorry we got in a fight yesterday. :(
Re: Sleeves,I will make sure these are input today. Thanks for your assistance with this matter.
Re: 9-25-00 Checkout,yep already been changed. Thanks
Re: Schedule,Hartman. It is possible that I may not be able to make the game tonight. I am probably going to have to work late to help out on a project. I will let you know if I can make it but at this point I would assume that I won't be there tonight. sorry man.
Help,I so do not want to be here today that i can hardly contain myself. I think I am going to surf the internet for business opportunities in the Carribean. I saw one of those damn Corona commercials on the big screen. Oh to be sitting on the beach and sipping Coronas right now! HELP!
Re: directions,do you need me to bring anything?
"Re: Deal #419638",You are correct and it has been changed. Thank you.
Re: The Beavs,yeah let me get back to you on where we will meet.
Re: The Beavs,I was planning on going down relatively early on Saturday morning with Sul and Sheffler. I would like to leave around 9:00 and go down and have breakfast and a few beers at the peacock as a good friend of mine owns it now and I would like to see him and what he has done to the place. You are more than welcome to come with us if you like.
Re: hoops,Yeah I will play. Who else is playing?
Re: hoops,I am totally down whenever you need people just let me know. I don't know where the fuck that is though.

Re: missing deal with APB,This is input and the transaction number is 418413 Sean forgot to put the broker in
Re: Missing Deal???,This is a good deal based on what I have discussed with the trader and based on the EES ticket so I will go ahead and input and then backdate the transaction
"Re: Deals #417310 & #417311",Thank you.
Re: missing deals,deal has been changed
RE: hi!,sounds good. Have a great weekend. GO BRUINS!

Re: missing deals,trader wrote deal down wrong in log. delivery point is mid c I will change in a few minutes.
Re: missing deals,I just checke dwith the broker and the trader and the trade date on this deal should be the 19th as input in enpower
Re: hi!,I am doing pretty good. I have been really busy lately. And the work situation should be resolved sometime next week as I am interviewing for two other internal positions on the trading desk. Family is okay I guess. Dad is not doing well at all and was almost checked into the hospital yesterday. Angela is really really worried about him and we talk just about everyday. I am in the process of getting the documents for power of attorney in case anything happens to him and he is incapacitated or something. I had a very interesting weekend last weekend. Just a whole bunch of crazy shit happened. It was all fun stuff though. How about you?
RE: Beaver Game,Its no big deal. I just had really bad asthma when I went down to wilsons house and he had that dog and ended up sleeping in my car which kind of sucked. If they are going to be outside or in the garage I may still come down Friday night or just come down Saturday and stay the night saturday night down there with you guys. I will let you all know tonight
Beaver Game,Are you guys going to the Beaver game this weekend and if so Wilson had mentioned that you guys were going down to his house on friday night. Is this correct? If so I would love to head down there with you guys on Friday but if not I will probably just stay in Portland and go to Corvallis on Saturday morning. Let me know.
Re:,You weren't totally out of control or anything. Just having a good time! I am usually the out of control one so I tend to give people a bit more slack because I don't want to get hassled to bad at a later date. How was your St Pattys Day?
Re:,yeah I found out later in the week that you guys were gone. Sounds like you had a great time! I love Italy. that place is so awesome. I was over there about the same time of year in 93 and it was great because there was less tourists and it was a little cheaper but the weather was still pretty good. You will have to tell me about it next time I see you. So I am going down to the Beaver game on Saturday but i might go down to Eugene and hang out with Wilson tommorow night. I will probably decide tonight but if I don't I would be into grabbing a few beers with you tommorow night after work.
Re: missing deals,Oh and the deal number for the second Mike S aquilla deal is 418401

Re: Fwd: NCAA Tournament Pool,Hey what are you doing after work?
Re: Drinking Green Beer,I will be down there earlier than that so just give me a call on my cell when you are coming down. You might spend a lot of time in line if you go down that late dude.

New Schedule,FYI. Bill has made a new schedule for the month of March. Please take a look.
Yo,Just bored and writting to say hi. What do you have going on this weekend?
Re: Complete Schedule,I think the only one I won't be able to make will be the one on the 15th. I work a night shift that night.
RE: Whats up?,Not the you part the Christa part.
RE: Whats up?,I have that affect on women
Whats up?,Yo whats up with you being so talkative toward me last night?
Re: beer?,That appears to be so!
Re: beer?,Didn't your mother teach you that it was rude to not answer someones questions?
beer?,Wanna grab a beer after work?
Re: Game,Yes we are
RE: yo,I don't even want to go close to what that dream is supposed to me. You looked pretty good in it though! :) Anyway whats the story one minute you tell me its a good idea for me to move the next you say I should stay! Good thing I don't listen to your advice.
RE: yo,So what the hell is Kims problem. You have been telling her for months that you were going to move out. What a bitch. Regarding the Nicole thing it really isn't that big of a deal anyway. When I am down there we go out but it's not like we are together or anything. I wouldn't let them hassle me affect whether I would date her or not but sometimes I just get a little sick of hearing about it all the time. Nicole is awesome and I like dating her while I am down there. It is just a wierd situation. About the moving to LA thing it really is a job issue at this point. It will be hard to find a job as good as the one that I currently have and that is going to be the real issue.
Re: xmas card,Hey there Kim! Sorry this response is so late! I read your email on a night when I was really busy and then just kind of spaced out in replying back. So I got your pictures and the card. Thanks a bunch! My Christmas went pretty well and I actually got to go out on New years eve as my schedule changed at the last minute. I went to the Hilton with my friend Valarie and it was pretty cool. I had a great time and ended up partying in a suite with these girls that I met there until about 5 am. I talked to Burns a few days ago and I guess he is still seeing that chick. I didn't ask about the living situation but I would imagine it would take some time to find a place down there. So anyway how was your New Year.? How did everything go with Ricky? I would be stoked if you came up for a long weekend or something! Anyway I gotta run. Talk to you later!
Re: **,No i guess not I was just giving you some shit and you didn't respond. Usually you respond when I give you shit

EES SUMMARY SHEET,The EES summary sheet is now in P/Realtime/EES/EES FEB. Just copy the EES deals over from the Inc. Sheet. Do not copy any colums past the Sell Price colum as it is not necessary for EES to have all our Info. Geir
Shift Notes,Please take the time to update the shift note throughout the day. The shift notes need to show more than just the status of the position manager. Extra information put in the shift note is helpful for other group members and for other traders on the floor. The shift notes are also a well used resource for volume and risk management groups. Communication is important for obvious reasons and I would like each member of the group to look to improve this aspect of their job performance. Bill

Re: beer?,That appears to be so!
Re: beer?,Didn't your mother teach you that it was rude to not answer someones questions?
beer?,Wanna grab a beer after work?
RE: yo,I don't even want to go close to what that dream is supposed to me. You looked pretty good in it though! :) Anyway whats the story one minute you tell me its a good idea for me to move the next you say I should stay! Good thing I don't listen to your advice.
RE: yo,So what the hell is Kims problem. You have been telling her for months that you were going to move out. What a bitch. Regarding the Nicole thing it really isn't that big of a deal anyway. When I am down there we go out but it's not like we are together or anything. I wouldn't let them hassle me affect whether I would date her or not but sometimes I just get a little sick of hearing about it all the time. Nicole is awesome and I like dating her while I am down there. It is just a wierd situation. About the moving to LA thing it really is a job issue at this point. It will be hard to find a job as good as the one that I currently have and that is going to be the real issue.

Re: xmas card,Hey there Kim! Sorry this response is so late! I read your email on a night when I was really busy and then just kind of spaced out in replying back. So I got your pictures and the card. Thanks a bunch! My Christmas went pretty well and I actually got to go out on New years eve as my schedule changed at the last minute. I went to the Hilton with my friend Valarie and it was pretty cool. I had a great time and ended up partying in a suite with these girls that I met there until about 5 am. I talked to Burns a few days ago and I guess he is still seeing that chick. I didn't ask about the living situation but I would imagine it would take some time to find a place down there. So anyway how was your New Year.? How did everything go with Ricky? I would be stoked if you came up for a long weekend or something! Anyway I gotta run. Talk to you later!

Hi,So are you not talking to me anymore or something? I emailed once and called twice in the past week and a half and haven't heard back from you?
Re: Real-Time Position Opening,Bill I have a freind that just graduated from Oregon State with a business degree i think his emphasis was MIS and finance. He is a pretty bright kid and wants to pursue a carrer in finance. I actually talked to him about it at some length about Enron on New Years Day and he seemed very interested. . He is a friend of mine from my fraternity and a really good guy who I think would fit in well here if given the opportunity. I dont know about your feelings on hiring guys right out of college. I know we had done so in the past but I wasn't really sure about your feelings on that. Let me know.
Trade Agent/Transmission Purchasing,Lately there have been several questions concerning transmission purchases from WACM or BCHA. In order to access these OASIS Nodes we need to log on to Trade Agent in Terminal Server. The Trade Agent login is on the same menu as Enpower and CAPS. Open Trade Agent and log in using the EPMI Control Room Certificate. Trade Agent will then prompt you for the password. Please see me for the password. You will then be able to access the OASIS websites and schedule power across the rockies(Canadian or US). The websites can be found in Cara's emails concerning the Westpower scheduling database. Please take the time to become familiar with this system. Bill

Re: Marc Coming to Town,Hey how late will he be here on sunday. I think I get in town at 5
Hey,So what time did you end up getting home on Saturday night. I was absolutely demolished on Sunday and left the house only to come down and pick up my car which was at the Embassy Suites? Did ya have fun?
Re: Marc Coming to Town,Sorry won't be there as I am going down to San Fran to have a few brews with Burns for the weekend.
Re: holiday ale fest,Where is the Holiday ale fest? Is it cool? Are you on some sort of secret beer newsletter that I am not getting? How come I only hear about this shit from you? I feel out of touch with the world of brewdom
holiday ale fest,anyone planning on going to this shindig this weekend? i am going on Friday after work but if people would rather go Saturday then that would be copacetic.
RE: Yo,Wow! Someone has lost there sense of humor! Maybe you are having an estrogen overdose.
RE: Yo,I knew that would get you all worked up!
RE: Yo,I don't believe for a second that you didn't make plans with Dave! Monday will probably be okay. I would say lets plan on it but I know how bad you are about shit like that so just call me Sunday and let me know. If I don't hear from you by then I will just assume we aren't going. have a great day
RE: Yo,I could probably do monday night. I will have to get back to you. What happened to Friday?
RE: Yo,when am i getting my victory dinner. I figure I ought to hit you up now before you get bac together with dave
Re: SF,Whats up lil' Kirky. Don't worry about getting cut off I figured your phone just died or something. I am so excited to come down there and hang out in the city. I haven't hung out in the City since turning 21 and would love to go check things out. That would be awesome if you could come into town on Wednesday or Thursday night. Maybe we could grab dinner and some drinks. I called your brother last night and left a message telling him that I was going to be in town. Hopefully he isn't mad at me for all the assing out I did the weekend of Wilsons wedding. I think my body is still recovering from all those shenanigans. Anyway I will give you a call or email you early next week and let you know what our plan is for Wednesday and Thursday. Look forward to seeing ya sweetie. Take Care!

Re: I'm so sorry,Dont worry about it. I had a good time. I don't really know what our plan is for the Beaver Game as I am hanging out with Burns and some guys from my fraternity and hadn't really planned on hanging out with those guys until after the game. But you can give me a call on my cell phone that day and I can let you know where the Winnebago is and maybe you guys can come meet us or if not we can meet up after the game or something.

Re: tonight,Hey there. I am back and at work today. Thank you for the phone calls and sorry I didnt return them but I was just entirely to busy and recieved too many calls to return them all until I came home. I hope everything is going well for you. We will have to get together and grab a bite to eat or a beer or something this week. How was your weekend?
RE:,No come to find out Angelas little friend had herpes! YUCK! But actually you know her. It is Nicole. The girl that Jay was dating for a while. Jay didn't care but it caused a huge fight between Angela and I. It was pretty messy.
RE:,I feel bad but she understands. I think she might come up and be with me for thanksgiving. I have a six day break right around then and I think it would be good for her to just get away for a while. Guess what? I had a couple of dates while I was in LA. They went very well and she might come up in December for a weekend!
RE:,How come you wanted a date for halloween then?
RE:,I just looked at myu schedule and I have to work neew years eve during the day and I don't know yet about new years day.. It really isn't that big of a deal to me. The important thing for me right now is spending my free time to go down and spend time with my sister so I could kind of care less about going to the Beavers Bowl game when I can just watch it on TV. I mean it would be nice to go but it is not the slightest bit a priority for me right now. So are you and dave seeing each other exclusively or are you dating other people?
RE:,I just wasnt sure what we were doing thats all. Yes if the Beavs go I will go if i have the day off but it is not likely they will. We have to beat the ducks which is reasonable but UW has to lose which is not likely. Likely we will go to the holliday or sun bowls.
RE:,I said you cant just take away the dinner offer. I wanted to go to dinner but if you thought it was going to be a big issue between you and Dave I didn't want to cause a fight between you two or something.
RE:,so are we just doing lunch then or dinner or dinner at your parents or what?
RE:,So.........
RE:,Well you cant just take away the dinner offer. I just don't want to get you in trouble with Dave.
RE:,Uh.....sure I guess. Would Dave have a problem with that?
RE:,I don't work on thursday or Friday so I could meet you guys for lunch either of those days. Or we could grab a drink after work. It would be nice to hang out more than just a few minutes for lunch.
Re:,Thanks I so much appreciate the support. Actually I just got back from LA today so sorry I didnt write back. My father passed away a couple weeks ago and I have been down there taking care of everything for my sister. It has been a rough month. I will write back later in the week or maybe call you or something. How is everything with you?

RE:,Is his drinking problem that bad or are his friends over reacting? Not to pile on or anything but yeah that was a bad idea bringing it up when he was drinking.
This weeks pick,This week I am picking San Diego to lose to the Rams.
RE:,uh.. how do I get a hold of you these days?
RE:,Do you want me to have him call you even if I don't go out with them?
RE:,I don't even know Dave so I wouldn't judge him. I just worry about you being with someone that has a bad temper like that. You know eventually that temper might be aimed at you. I know you can take care of yourself and I am sure he is a great guy and wouldn't do anything to hurt you but that doesn't mean I can't worry about ya. :) So I didn't go anywhere last night. I am feeling pretty sick and Burnsy's flight got cancelled so he didn't get in until about 12 last night. I haven't talked to him yet today and last time I talked to him i told him I had plans tonight which have been changed. I would like to go out with him but I don't really feel like drinking and I am really trying to cut back on it. This thing with my dad has really scared me about drinking and bieng more healthy. I am not pretending that I am going to stop drinking I just think it would be a great idea for me to cut back on it. There is no need for me to get as drunk as I did last weekend. Boy is that a great story! If I do go out with Burns tonight should I call you?
Supplemental Entry in Caps,There had been some interest in this. See me with questions...there is a hard copy in your mailbox.
Re: where did you go?,what are you talking about?
RE:,Actually that doesnt sound very funny to me. I mean what the fuck did he do that for? What was he so mad about? I can imagine that you would be scared seeing him act like that. Hopefully he doesn't ever act like that or show that kind of temper around you. Anyway its really none of my business i guess. I appreciate the sentiment about my family and I will mention it to my mother. I hope you feel better.
Re: hoops,I am probably not going to make it. A) I am feeling sick. B) Burns is in town and if I am feeling better I wanted to hang out with him.
RE: FW: dunk heard round the world ......,I am not sure yet. I will email you tommorow morning and let you know.

RE: good movies,Thanks that was awfully sweet of you.
RE: good movies,What happened?
RE: good movies,Just little things like I should be resolving my job situation by the end of next week and some other little stuff that has made me happy and a little more confident about stuff. Nothing too major. After how things went the last few months it doesn't take much!
RE: good movies,Mine doesnt suck either. I have actually had some good stuff happen to me lately!
RE: good movies,Yeah yeah yeah. My life sucks too!
Re: good movies,Thanks for the movie advice. I am glad that you went out with Kathy and Charlene. I think it is good for you guys to keep in touch. I know people move on with their lives and grow out of touch but it seems like you guys have been friends for so long that it would be a shame for you to not keep in touch with each other. Sorry we got in a fight yesterday. :(
Re: Sleeves,I will make sure these are input today. Thanks for your assistance with this matter.
Re: 9-25-00 Checkout,yep already been changed. Thanks

Re: hi!,I am doing pretty good. I have been really busy lately. And the work situation should be resolved sometime next week as I am interviewing for two other internal positions on the trading desk. Family is okay I guess. Dad is not doing well at all and was almost checked into the hospital yesterday. Angela is really really worried about him and we talk just about everyday. I am in the process of getting the documents for power of attorney in case anything happens to him and he is incapacitated or something. I had a very interesting weekend last weekend. Just a whole bunch of crazy shit happened. It was all fun stuff though. How about you?
RE: Beaver Game,Its no big deal. I just had really bad asthma when I went down to wilsons house and he had that dog and ended up sleeping in my car which kind of sucked. If they are going to be outside or in the garage I may still come down Friday night or just come down Saturday and stay the night saturday night down there with you guys. I will let you all know tonight
Beaver Game,Are you guys going to the Beaver game this weekend and if so Wilson had mentioned that you guys were going down to his house on friday night. Is this correct? If so I would love to head down there with you guys on Friday but if not I will probably just stay in Portland and go to Corvallis on Saturday morning. Let me know.
Re:,yeah I found out later in the week that you guys were gone. Sounds like you had a great time! I love Italy. that place is so awesome. I was over there about the same time of year in 93 and it was great because there was less tourists and it was a little cheaper but the weather was still pretty good. You will have to tell me about it next time I see you. So I am going down to the Beaver game on Saturday but i might go down to Eugene and hang out with Wilson tommorow night. I will probably decide tonight but if I don't I would be into grabbing a few beers with you tommorow night after work.

So I got your pictures and the card. Thanks a bunch! My Christmas went pretty well and I actually got to go out on New years eve as my schedule changed at the last minute. I went to the Hilton with my friend Valarie and it was pretty cool. I had a great time and ended up partying in a suite with these girls that I met there until about 5 am. I talked to Burns a few days ago and I guess he is still seeing that chick. I didn't ask about the living situation but I would imagine it would take some time to find a place down there.

Please take the time to become familiar with this system. Bill

The ISO is now cutting our exports,In addition to the ISO derating its own available transmission capacity (exporting) at the California Oregon Border (so that people can't buy transmission from the ISO to export power) the ISO is now threatening to cut our exports from California using transmission rights that we have purchased from a muni that is not part of the ISO's grid.

Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks.

FERC Contact Re:  Enron Situation Impact on Pipelines,I received a call from Jim Guest at the FERC OCA this afternoon concerning the Enron situation. He had read the articles and heard the reports. Wanted to know if bad accounting was the root of the problem. I advised him that it was bad investments that was the real issue. He asked about the use of the pipeline assets to pull Enron thru the liquidity crisis. I gave him a brief overview of the Dynegy cash infusion and the bank revolvers. He said there was some concern at the FERC that projects we might be proposing may not be able to be funded due to the reduced ability of the pipelines to obtain outside financing due to the securitization of the all the assets. I indicated that it was my opinion that good investments in pipeline facilities would probably be looked on favorably at Enron these days. Thought you'd want a quick update. I haven't advised Drew or Greg Porter yet. Thought you might want to cover with them.
Enron Corp. S&P Rating B-,Please give me a call in regard to the demand letters. Thanks and Regards.

Short Pay - Texaco,Texaco has short paid us by 1.5 million for Socal cuts. I believe that they claimed a penalty on the net out for the amount. We do not agree with this short pay and stand by the description of the Socal product in which it states that there will be cuts due to operational constraints on the upstream pipelines. I would like to return the short pay favor to Texaco. Please let me know how we should proceed. Mike Grigsby

Favor to ask.,How are you/maybe one day the OSU football coach will know how to deal with that team from the north! I'm in a group at ees that is gradually progressing towards a contract briefing system; once we decide on the software and system ( i went to a global contract presentation which didn't bring back only bad memories!). I know that we will end up with a similar document to what was used (and is still used i believe) in ENA with some differences due to the disparate types of customers. Do you have a word version (even an older document would be fine) of that template? I understand that now the ENA briefing system is 'online'.
Re: Pacific Gas & Electric Payments,Thanks. I will sit down with accounting and go through the math on that basis and let you know if it seems all is in order. If we send a letter in any event I will run the draft passed you. Again many thanks.

Broadband,I checked with Rick Buy's group on where they were on The RAROC analysis of your proposed broadband project. They aren't doing anything according to Rod who checked for me. It seems to me that we need to do several things to either kick this into gear or to put it on hold pending completion of a sale. 1. We need to find out from Mark Metts if this deal adds any value to the transactions being proposed. I will talk with Mitch and Mark about this issue. 2. We need to determine EBS interest in this business..ie are they a buyer or seller of Portland metro dark fiber. If they want to be in this business wouldn't it make to develop this project as EBS and not to include it in a sale? 3. A project of this size will take Jeff's approval. The projected Phase I capital is above my threshold. I will talk with Kevin Hannon and Mitch and then get back with you. Sound like a plan?
"Re: Lots of Stuff Thanks for the information of the Fiber project.
 It was helpful. Kevin I are trying to get together to discuss. It probably
 be later in the week. I will follow-up on the status of the Phase I DASH.
 Please get with Greg Whalley to discus",Probably replacing Ken Harrison with myself is the right movr. Please go ahead and handle making the necessary changes. Thanks.
Re: 7th Annual OGA College World Series Golf Classic,I would love to come and participate. I think the best I can do is come in the night before and perhaps(?) attend the night game and then do the golf tournament the next day and leave after the dinner. Talk with Dave about who I should be paired up with. I would like to play with either him or Mike McGowan also. Tell Dave he stood me up last year but it was worth it.

Broadband,I checked with Rick Buy's group on where they were on The RAROC analysis of your proposed broadband project. They aren't doing anything according to Rod who checked for me.

They have asked if ETS/EGS will be reducing head count so that they can make the appropriate modifications to the Enron Net Works staff.

GOLF,UNFORTUNATELY!! work totalled interfered with my plans to go to the Masters last weekend. I was so mad I didn't even want to play golf. I am over that now and would like to play this coming weekend. I can play Saturday morning (need to finish by 2pm). or Sunday morning. I will be out of town Wednesday thru Friday so just let Cindy know if anyone can play. Have a good week.

Broadband,I checked with Rick Buy's group on where they were on The RAROC analysis of your proposed broadband project. They aren't doing anything according to Rod who checked for me. It seems to me that we need to do several things to either kick this into gear or to put it on hold pending completion of a sale. 1. We need to find out from Mark Metts if this deal adds any value to the transactions being proposed. I will talk with Mitch and Mark about this issue. 2. We need to determine EBS interest in this business..ie are they a buyer or seller of Portland metro dark fiber. If they want to be in this business wouldn't it make to develop this project as EBS and not to include it in a sale? 3. A project of this size will take Jeff's approval. The projected Phase I capital is above my threshold. I will talk with Kevin Hannon and Mitch and then get back with you. Sound like a plan?
Benefit Plans,I will discuss your recommendation to seperate PGE from Enron's Health and Welfare Benefits with Cynthia Barrow and Mark Metts in the near future and will get back to you once that meeting is over.
Golf,Golf is scheduled for 2pm Saturday. Lousy start time but evidently they have a tournament of some sort on Saturday morning. Let me know if you can play or not. It is only you and I. Phone numbers are: work 713.853.6177. Home 281.320.1240. Also please email your phone numbers for future reference. No one has them.

At the next Board meeting I am sheduled to provide the Board with an update of Enron Global Services. Could you have someone prepare a couple of slides on Portland. One should deal with the major accomplishements of your group in 2001 (ie rate case etc) in bullet form. The second should be an update of the deal with NNG. Perhaps a summary of the deal and then where we are in the timeline of key events. Call if you have questions. Thanks. The Board meeting is scheduled for December 6th.
RE: VP Candidate Greg Shea,Sorry I guess I didn't read it very well. It's ok with me.
Meeting with El Paso,I met with Byron Kelley who runs El Paso's international business. He is an old business aquaintance that I had not visited with in several years. Byron assured me that he would stop the type of press like the article you sent. He reiterated although that El Paso has had good success in dealing with the government in a very private way and did not want to publicise any differences that they may have with the government from time to time. He was willing to stop the press articles that defined differences between El Paso and Enron in their approach to Brazil but had no desire to join Enron in publically trying to effectuate change in Brazil. The meeting was very friendly. Let me know if I can be of further help. Hope all is well with you and you and your family.
PGE Trojan Nuclear Plant decommissioning,Jack Urquhart has inquired as to his continuing role for providing oversight of the Trojan decommissioning. I think he sits on the review committee. Please give your thoughts on this. I think we need someone from Enron on the committee but given Jack's changing role he may or may not be the right person. Please acknowledge receipt of this given our email difficulties. Thanks Stan

Re: 7th Annual OGA College World Series Golf Classic,I would love to come and participate. I think the best I can do is come in the night before and perhaps(?) attend the night game and then do the golf tournament the next day and leave after the dinner. Talk with Dave about who I should be paired up with. I would like to play with either him or Mike McGowan also. Tell Dave he stood me up last year but it was worth it.
"Re: Lots of Stuff Thanks for the information of the Fiber project.
 It was helpful. Kevin I are trying to get together to discuss. It probably
 be later in the week. I will follow-up on the status of the Phase I DASH.

Re: RESPONSE NEEDED,Since we are in the process of trying to exit this business the answer from Enron Wind would be no. You might want to contact Condy Plson to see if the idea has any value to Enron.
Re: TW Mainline Capacity & Station 8,I agree. There have been way too many surprises from this group lately.

Re: EEI Response to Strawman,I recieved the same document. If you would distribute it to the committee that would be appreciated. I would think we might want to discuss it at the Board meeting prior to setting up another meeting with EEI. What do you think? I can see pros and cons of meeting with EEI prior to the next Board meeting. Depending on the strawman I feel we are beginning to lose key support from the Board to work this matter. Bill we need to get the Board to continue to follow him if we are to make progress.
Re: morning 11/27,Good morning. Thanks for the yahoo greeting. It made my day. Have a great day. Remember that Cathy and Carol's birthday is Nov. 30th.

I have not gotten that ISDA Master out yet because there are some things in the credit worksheet that don't jive with the credit terms in the current master as well as credit terms generally consistent on this side of the Atlantic. I have asked Jay Williams in our Credit Dept. here to get with the credit person there in London who worked up the credit worksheet to clear up the credit terms. I have drafted the ISDA with everything except making the credit choices so it sits there waiting for credit. Just wanted to keep you updated...
