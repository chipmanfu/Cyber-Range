# CyberRange
The CyberRange is a project to create a simulated internet environment for Cyber training and exercises.  This environment has some built in features to help automate things for cyber threat emulation by handling things like IP assignment, DNS registration, Signed SSL cert generation for threat infrastructure systems like redirectors, Cobalt Strike teamservers, payload hosting and phishing attacks.  Additional consideration and features have been added to generate benign network traffic to improve realism.
